            D.Va, real name Hana Song, is a South Korean mecha pilot and former pro gamer from Busan. She pilots a combat mecha armed with twin Fusion Cannons, shotgun-like weapons that require no ammunition or reload time. Her mecha is equipped with rocket Boosters for short bursts of flight, as well as a Defense Matrix that allows it to shoot enemy projectiles out of the air. She can also fire a volley of Micro-Missiles that do splash damage on impact. D.Va's ultimate ability, Self-Destruct, overloads and detonates her mecha, dealing massive damage to all enemies in a huge radius within line of sight. If her mech is destroyed (either by her ultimate or in combat), she ejects and continues to fight on foot, armed with a mid-range Light Gun, until her mecha can be summoned again.

            Doomfist is both the name of the titular cybernetic gauntlet and the title of its wielder, who is currently the Nigerian-born Akande Ogundimu, businessman and mixed martial artist turned mercenary. He has a short-range Hand Cannon on his off-hand that fires shotgun-like bursts and regenerates ammo over time, but most of his abilities come through melee attacks from the Doomfist Gauntlet. Doomfist can charge up a Rocket Punch that lets him lunge forward and punch an opponent backwards, a Seismic Slam that launches enemies in its range a short distance towards Doomfist, and a Rising Uppercut that greatly launches a single enemy while doing damage. Each ability that successfully hits also generates personal shielding for Doomfist (The Best Defense...). Doomfist's ultimate ability is named Meteor Strike, allowing him to jump into the air and slam the ground, damaging all enemies in a range around that point and pushing them back a short distance.

McCree's ultimate ability is Deadeye, which allows him to line up headshots on every enemy in his sight, with resulting damage proportional to the time spent aiming.

            Orisa is a one-month-old, four-legged female Omnic built by 11-year-old robotics prodigy Efi Oladele, to be a "mechanical peacekeeper" of Numbani. Her primary weapon is the Fusion Driver, a long-range projectile-based machine gun; its alternate fire mode, Halt!, releases a slow-moving projectile that the player can detonate to draw in nearby enemies towards the point of detonation, similar to Zarya's Graviton Surge. She can launch a deployable Protective Barrier similar to Reinhardt's shield which can be used for strategic defenses, and can Fortify her structure to temporarily prevent all forms of crowd control against her, such as Lúcio's sonic blasts or Reinhardt's Earthshatter abilities. Her ultimate ability is Supercharger, a deployable device which gives Orisa and her teammates, provided they are in line-of-sight, an attack boost similar to that of Mercy, though the Supercharger itself can be destroyed by enemy fire and deactivates after a few seconds.

            Reinhardt, full name Reinhardt Wilhelm, is a German soldier and adventurer, and one of the founding members of Overwatch. He wears a heavy suit of Crusader power armor, and carries a rocket-powered war hammer (Rocket Hammer) as his primary weapon. His main ability is a wide hard-light Barrier Field mounted on his arm that allows him to protect himself and teammates behind him from enemy fire. He may also launch a flaming projectile that ignores enemy barriers (Fire Strike), or use a rocket booster to Charge into the enemy lines, crushing them against walls. His ultimate ability, Earthshatter, makes him slam his hammer against the ground, sending out a shockwave that incapacitates enemies in front of him.

            Roadhog, real name Mako Rutledge, is Junkrat's enforcer and bodyguard of unknown nationality. He wields a Scrap Gun that fires shrapnel in a mid-range automatic firing mode, or a short-range shotgun-like single shot. He also carries a NOS canister filled with "Hogdrogen" to self-heal (Take a Breather), and employs a Chain Hook to pull distant opponents towards him. His ultimate ability, Whole Hog, allows him to put a top loader into his scrap gun, firing it in full auto mode with increased knockback, wider spread, and no need to reload.

            Sombra, real name Olivia Colomar, is a Mexican hacker and infiltrator. She is equipped with a low-damage, high-capacity Machine Pistol for short range combat. Her trademark ability allows her to Hack enemies, turrets or neutral health kits. Hacked enemies cannot use their abilities, hacked turrets are disabled, and hacked health kits respawn faster and become unusable to the enemy team. Sombra also has Thermoptic Camo that gives her a period of invisibility paired with a speed boost, and can throw down a Translocator beacon that she can to teleport to later. Her passive ability, Opportunist, enables her to track enemies that are low on health, even through walls. Sombra's ultimate ability is EMP, an electromagnetic shockwave that hacks all enemies around her, as well as disabling their barriers and shields and displaying if they have fully charged ultimates.

Symmetra is the only character with two ultimate abilities: Teleporter, which creates a persisting warp tunnel leading from the team's spawn point to the deployed location, and Shield Generator, which constructs an energy node providing all teammates in range with additional shielding.

She is also able to project a personal Particle Barrier onto herself or onto one of her teammates (Projected Barrier), and soaking up damage with these shields raises the power of her own attacks proportionally. Zarya's ultimate ability, Graviton Surge, forms a gravity well that pulls enemies in and damages them, leaving them open to other attacks.

            Zenyatta, full name Tekhartha Zenyatta, is an omnic monk and wanderer. Rather than moving on foot, he floats above the ground in a meditative pose. He is surrounded by a circle of floating metal orbs named the Orbs of Destruction (resembling prayer beads), which he can use to launch a form of energy to damage foes, either one at a time or through a charged-shot. He can also cast these orbs onto teammates as Orbs of Harmony to regenerate health, or onto enemies as Orbs of Discord that lower their defenses. His ultimate ability is Transcendence, which makes him temporarily invulnerable and applies massive regenerative effects to his allies in a large radius around him.
